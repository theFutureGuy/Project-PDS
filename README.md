Welcome to Project-PDS

As of now we have almost completed the frontend part of our project.
We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, SCSS, Bootstrap 5.

Our Project currently includes two dashboards
     - one dashboard for the central entity that monitors all of the retail outlets that fall inside the boundaries of the authority
     - another dashboard for each of the ration outlets that deal directly with the public
     

Since our project is a prototype, we are going to focus on Chennai corporation, but the functionality can be modelled to a much much bigger area as well. The idea remains the same.

Let us take a closer look at each of the dashboards

The central dashboard:

The central dashboard derives the data from the smart contract implemented in the blockchain. The smart contract running on the blockchain is constantly updating the values owing to the transactions happening at the ration outlets. The dashboard will be used by the officials to monitor the transactions happening at all the outlets and will help them take informed decisions regarding the surplus of food grains, if any, generated at the outlets, thus leading to effecient food management. The smart contract ensures that all the transactions are accounted for.


The ration outlet dashboard:
     This folder consists of the screen that is visible in every ration shop.
     It is the personalized dashboard for ration shopkeepers and can give details of the monthly allocated stocks for that shop and for the individual people that is to be given.
     it is retrived from blockchain and confirmed by smart contracts.
